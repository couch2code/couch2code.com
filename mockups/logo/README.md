The logo for couch2code is comprised of:

* 1 line of 3 pairs of parentheses, with at least one em space between each pair
* 1 line directly below the parentheses, consisting of 7 equals signs in a row, no spaces
* 1 pair of square brackets on the outside of both the parentheses and equals signs
	- The height of the square brackets is approximately 3x the height of the equals sign
	- The top of the equals signs horizontally aligns with the middle of the square brackets
	- The top of the square brackets horizontally aligns with the middle of the parentheses
* The centers of the above 3 objects are vertically aligned
* The total width from the outside of the leftmost parenthesis to the outside of the rightmost parenthesis is 95-100% of the width of the 7 equals signs

Fonts and proportions should be chosen to meet the above. The logo.svg here is an example implementation.
