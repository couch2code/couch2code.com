## Ideas for workflow

- Index View	
	- A trending list of popular challenges
	- Newly submitted challenges
- Registration
	- Unlinked from profile completion (Issue #3)
- Login
- Create a New Challenge
- Edit a New Challenge
	- If we go extension route, can others expand on someone else's challenge? Seems a good way to expand challenges
- View a Challenge
- Post a Your Challenge Result Link
- Rate/Comment on a Challenge Result
- Profile
- Member Ranking Algorithm (Based on Challenges Contributed and Challenge Results Submitted)

## Additional features?
- Forum?
- IRC?
- Achievements?
- Experience / Levelling up?
- Tag challenges? (e.g. tags for language-specific challenges, problem areas?)
- User stats page?
	- If we go with challenge extensions, breakdown completion ratios of completed/eligible per theme
	- Most helpful comments
		- Roll this into a StackExchange-like "reputation"?
	- Challenges completed, perhaps a histogram of performance relative to par
	- Publicly visible?
	- Achievements/Experience if implemented?
