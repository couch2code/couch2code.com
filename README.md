Couch2code is a social site dedicated to the art of learning to code by practice.  Either getting started or continuing to refine and deepen your development skills is largely a result of practice and pushing your limits.

Couch2code is a site that registered developers can post practice exercises/challenges that anyone can participate in.  When a user decides to participate in a particular challenge, they can post a link to their sourcecode and community members can review, comment and rate.  While rating each implementation may make it fun, it should not lose focus of the main reason for posting your work, which is to get genuine feedback on your effort, and hopefully tips on how you can improve.  Everyone can improve, that what makes programming so great, I can always do better than what I did yesterday, with more practice, learning and effort.
